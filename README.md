A work in progress to apply practical applications to the Python I've been learning.

Completed:

- comparison_generator function that is used to generate a list of binary column headers.
- Basic script, it currently generates the correct decimal conversion, but it's untidy.

To-to:

- Split the code that splits the outputted list into four-digit strings into a seperate function.
- Fix the afformentioned function so that it generates four-digit nibbles properly.
