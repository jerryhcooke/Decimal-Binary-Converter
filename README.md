# Decimal to Binary Converter

An attempt at creating a simple decimal to binary converter, using comparison looping rather than a recursion based technique.

## Getting Started

These instructions will allow you to test the code on your own system.

### Prerequisites

The converter is being programmed with Python3, so is not backward compatible. 

```
Python 3.x
```

### Installing

Download the Zip from above or clone the repo to a local directory. Then simply run Decimal_to_Binary_Converter.py.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jerryhcooke/Decimal-Binary-Converter.git
```
